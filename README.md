# pronunciation_prediction
This project was done in May 2020 as a part of the Machine Learning for Linguists-course in University of Helsinki. The main goal of this project was to train a Hidden Markov Model classifier to predict the pronunciation of English words and test its accuracy. This is the first machine learning project I've done.
